# Object-Oriented Programming Project in Java
This academic project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course to enhance the understanding of fundamental object-oriented programming concepts and apply these concepts in practice using the Java programming language. The project is divided into three exercises, each addressing a specific aspect of object-oriented programming.

## Exercise 1: Class for Representing a Circle
### Description
In this exercise, a class was created to represent a geometric circle. The class has attributes for the radius and the coordinates of the circle's center, as well as methods for constructing objects, increasing the radius, setting the center, calculating the area, and the circumference length.

### Features
Construction of Circle objects by specifying the radius and coordinates.
Increasing the circle's radius by a defined percentage.
Setting the coordinates of the circle's center.
Calculating the area of the circle.
Calculating the circumference length.

## Exercise 2: Class for Representing a Conventional Automobile
### Description
In this exercise, a class was implemented to model an automobile. The class has attributes such as mileage, fuel volume, tank capacity, maximum and current speeds, average acceleration, and average fuel consumption. Methods were developed to refuel the vehicle, accelerate, brake, obtain the current speed, and check the current fuel volume.

### Features
Creation of Car objects with mandatory attributes.
Refueling the vehicle with volume calculation and fuel consumption.
Acceleration for a specified time interval.
Braking for a specified time interval.
Obtaining the current speed of the vehicle.
Obtaining the current fuel volume.

## Exercise 3: System for a Vehicle Dealership
### Description
In this exercise, a system for a vehicle dealership was developed, covering various types of vehicles (hatchback, sedan, pickup truck, SUV) and motorcycles. The system records transactions involving the purchase and sale of vehicles, including sellers and customers. The program features a terminal-based interface with numbered menus for accessing functionalities.

### Features
Recording transactions for buying and selling vehicles.
Management of vehicle types (cars and motorcycles).
Recording information about sellers and customers.
User interface in the terminal with enumerated menus.
